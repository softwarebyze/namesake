# Namesake

I wanted to test out this component library called gluestack-ui so I ran `npm create gluestack`, as instructed by the [documentation](https://gluestack.io/ui/docs/getting-started/installation). It asked me for a project name, so I had to come up with something...

I am awful at remembering people's names so the point of this app just to let you save personal names.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
# For web
yarn web
# For ios
yarn ios
# For android
yarn android
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `App.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`@gluestack-ui`](https://ui.gluestack.io/docs/overview/introduction) library that provides optionally styled and accessible components. These components are designed for easy integration into applications developed with React and React Native.
